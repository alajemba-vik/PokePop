# PokePop
PokéPop adds a playful twist to your coding experience with Pokémon animations that pop up from different parts of your screen. Whether you’re deep in debugging or celebrating a successful build, PokéPop keeps things lively — and even helps you blink and take quick mental breaks during long coding sessions.
